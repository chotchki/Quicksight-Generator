# Release Notes

## v0.2.0

### Consolidated single-analysis architecture

The separate reconciliation analysis has been merged into the financial analysis as the **Payment Reconciliation** tab. The project now generates one analysis and one dashboard (down from two of each), reducing deployment complexity and enabling cross-sheet drill-down without URL-based linking.

### Payment-only reconciliation

Reconciliation now correctly focuses on payments -- the only records that leave the internal system. Sales and settlements no longer have external transaction IDs or recon views. This eliminated 3 datasets, 2 database views, and the `late_thresholds` table.

### New features

- **Payment Reconciliation tab** with 3 KPIs (matched amount, unmatched amount, late count), a stacked bar chart (match status by external system), and dual mutually-filterable tables (external transactions and internal payments)
- **Mutual table filtering** -- click an external transaction to see its linked payments; click a payment to filter back to its transaction
- **Config-driven late threshold** (`late_threshold_days`, default 30) replaces the database table. Users can also adjust interactively via the days-outstanding slider
- **Same-sheet chart filtering** on all tabs -- clicking a bar or pie slice filters the detail table on the same sheet
- **Cross-sheet drill-down** -- click a settlement row to jump to Sales filtered by that settlement; click a payment row to jump to Settlements

### Breaking changes

- `recon-analysis.json` and `recon-dashboard.json` are no longer generated. Delete them from AWS before deploying (`./deploy.sh --delete`)
- Dataset count reduced from 11 to 8. The removed datasets: `qs-gen-sales-recon-dataset`, `qs-gen-settlement-recon-dataset`, `qs-gen-recon-exceptions-dataset`
- `external_transaction_id` removed from sales and settlements datasets/schema
- `transaction_type` removed from external_transactions dataset/schema
- `late_thresholds` table removed from demo schema
- `build_recon_analysis()` and `build_recon_dashboard()` no longer exist

### Bug fixes

- Fixed `DefaultFilterControlConfiguration` rejection by using `SINGLE_DATASET` scope with direct filter controls for single-sheet filters
- Fixed `SetParametersOperation` requiring a preceding `NavigationOperation`
- Fixed QuickSight rejecting multiple `DATA_POINT_CLICK` actions on a single visual
